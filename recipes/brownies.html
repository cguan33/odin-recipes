    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    
        <uo>

            <li>10 Tbsp. (145 grams) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1 1/4 cup (250 grams) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (80 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder, natural or Dutch-process</li>
            <li>1/4 rounded teaspoon kosher salt, use slightly less if using fine sea or table salt</li>
            <li>2 large cold eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (65 grams) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2/3 cup (75 grams) chopper walnuts or pecans, optional</li>
        </uo>
    
    

    <h4><strong>Steps</strong></h4>
    
        <ol>
            <li>
                Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch x 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on opposite sides to help remove the baked brownies from the pan.
            
            
            </li>
        
            <li>Prepare a double-boiler by filling a medium saucepan with water about 2 inches deep. Heat the water until barely simmering.</li>
        
            <li>Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium heat-safe bowl. Rest the bowl over the simmering water. If the bottom of the bowl touches the water, remove a little water from the saucepan.</li>
        
            <li>Stir the mixture occasionally until the butter has melted and the mixture is quite warm. Don’t worry if it looks gritty; it will become smooth once you add the eggs and flour.</li>
        
            <li>Remove the bowl from the saucepan, and set aside for 5 minutes or until it is only warm, not hot.</li>
        

            <li>Stir in the vanilla.</li>
        
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, stirring vigorously after each one.</li>
        
            <li>When the batter looks thick and well blended, add the flour. Use a spoon to beat the flour into the batter until it is very thick and pulls away from the sides of the bowl.</li>
        
            <li>Stir in nuts if using.</li>
        
            <li>Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.</li>

            <li>Bake the brownies until the edges look dry and the middle looks slightly underbaked; 20 to 30 minutes. You can test doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center. The brownies are finished baking if it comes out with a few moist crumbs attached.</li>
        
            <li>Cool completely before removing from the pan — <em>this step is essential and helps the brownies set. </em>Cut into 16 squares.</li>
        
        </ol>
